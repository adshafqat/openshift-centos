Becuase I am not using a DNS server so to access application I need to update my laptop host file and add following entry

51.145.113.11 mglusterapp-my-project.apps.52.151.118.150.xip.io

This is the public ip of my infra node and application URL. Please note, I configured apps.52.151.118.150.xip.io in inventory file as openshift_master_default_subdomain

sh-3.2# cat /etc/hosts
